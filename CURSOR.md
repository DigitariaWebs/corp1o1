# CURSOR.md - Corp101 Project Current State Documentation

## Project Overview
**Corp101** (Sokol Learning Platform) is a revolutionary AI-powered skills assessment and learning platform that replaces traditional diploma-based evaluation with real competency analysis. This document reflects the current state as of 2025.

### Recent changes (Aug 2025)
- Backend
  - Unified Mongo connection and deferred post-init to avoid buffering errors; removed unsupported options and several duplicate index declarations across models.
  - Renamed reserved `metadata.isNew` to `metadata.isNewlyAdded` in `LearningPath`.
  - **üÜï AI Service Manager Implementation**: Centralized AI orchestration with cost-optimized model selection
    - Different models for different tasks (GPT-4o for complex, GPT-4o-mini for simple)
    - Three AI personalities: ARIA (encouraging, 0.9 temp), SAGE (analytical, 0.3 temp), COACH (motivational, 0.7 temp)
    - Response caching with 5-minute TTL for performance
    - Real question generation for assessments (not mock data)
     - **üÜï Assessment Plan Persistence**: Generated plans now save to database
     - AI-generated assessments marked with `isAIGenerated: true`
     - Automatic question generation when starting AI assessments
     - Category mapping (Programming ‚Üí Technical Skills)
     - Required scoring fields automatically calculated
     - Fixed duplicate key error by removing unique constraint from embedded questionId field
  - Added endpoints:
    - `POST /api/assessments/generate-questions` (accepts difficulty in beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert and normalizes to easy/medium/hard)
    - `POST /api/assessments/evaluate` (accepts both 3- and 4-level difficulty; normalizes internally)
    - `POST /api/assessments/plan` (returns a plan of 3 tailored assessments from short intake, now saves to DB)
  - Dev auth bypass for local testing via header `x-dev-auth: true` (only active when not in production).
  - OpenAI calls now generate real content, with fallbacks for API failures.
- Frontend
  - Proxy routes to backend with dev fallback:
    - `app/api/assessments/generate-questions/route.ts`
    - `app/api/assessments/evaluate/route.ts`
    - `app/api/assessments/plan/route.ts`
  - Custom assessment wizard at `/assessments/new` to collect intake and generate a 3-item plan.
  - Auto-start flow: visiting `/assessments?planned=<json>` starts a Redux session, calls question generation, sets questions, and navigates into the assessment.
  - Redux thunks updated to accept optional token and surface backend error messages.

### How to test quickly
- Backend (no Clerk needed in dev): pass `x-dev-auth: true` header.
  - Generate questions
    - POST `http://localhost:3001/api/assessments/generate-questions` with `{ assessmentId, title, category, difficulty, questionCount }`
  - Evaluate answer
    - POST `http://localhost:3001/api/assessments/evaluate` with `{ question, answer, personality, difficulty, points }`
  - Plan custom assessments
    - POST `http://localhost:3001/api/assessments/plan` with `{ primaryDomain, subdomains[], yearsExperience, goals, preferredDifficulty }`
- Frontend
  - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001` in `.env.local`.
  - Use `/assessments/new` to create a plan, then Start ‚Üí it auto-generates questions and navigates.
