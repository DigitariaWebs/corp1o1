# AI Personalization Integration - Complete Guide

## üéØ Overview
The Corp1o1 platform now features complete AI-powered personalization that flows through the ENTIRE platform, customizing every aspect of the user experience based on their onboarding data.

## üîÑ User Flow

### 1. New User Registration
- User signs up via Clerk
- User is automatically redirected to `/onboarding` if no personalization exists

### 2. AI Onboarding (/onboarding)
- **5-step intelligent onboarding process:**
  1. Goals & Role selection
  2. Skill domain preferences
  3. Experience & time commitment
  4. Learning style preference
  5. Confirmation & AI generation

### 3. AI Personalization Generation
- Backend generates 4 key components in parallel:
  - **personalizedContent**: Welcome message, priority skills, quick wins
  - **assessmentPlan**: Customized assessment sequence
  - **learningPath**: Personalized learning modules
  - **motivationalProfile**: Communication and engagement preferences

### 4. Platform-Wide Personalization
The AI-generated data personalizes:
- **Dashboard**: Custom welcome message, skill areas, learning paths
- **Assessments**: Personalized assessment sequence based on goals
- **Learning Paths**: Customized modules and progression
- **Recommendations**: AI-driven quick wins and next steps

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### /app/onboarding/page.tsx
- Main onboarding entry point
- Redirects users with existing personalization to dashboard
- Handles AI generation and saves to localStorage

#### /components/onboarding/intelligent-signup.tsx

- Auto-redirects to /onboarding if no personalization
- Shows personalized:
  - Welcome message
  - Skill progress areas
  - Learning paths
  - AI recommendations

#### /app/assessments/page.tsx
- Shows personalized assessment sequence
- Prioritizes assessments based on user goals
- No mock data - real backend integration only

### Backend Services

#### /routes/personalization.js
- POST /api/personalization/generate - Create new personalization
- GET /api/personalization - Fetch existing personalization
- DELETE /api/personalization/reset - Reset and start over

#### /services/personalizationService.js
- Generates all 4 personalization components
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model
- Parallel processing for performance
- Structured JSON responses

#### /controllers/personalizationController.js

## üîß Key Features

### Automatic Redirection
- New users without personalization ‚Üí /onboarding
- Completed users ‚Üí /dashboard with personalized content
- Existing personalization ‚Üí Skip onboarding

### Data Persistence
- **MongoDB**: Primary storage in User model
- **localStorage**: Immediate UI updates
- **Auth Context**: User object synchronization

### Real Backend Integration
- NO mock data in production flows
- Personalized assessments from AI
- Dynamic skill areas based on preferences
- Custom learning paths

### Debug Tools (Dashboard)
- "Refresh from DB" - Fetch latest from backend
- "Clear Local" - Clear localStorage cache
- Console logging for troubleshooting

## üöÄ Testing the Flow

1. **Clear existing data:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('userPersonalization')
   ```

2. **Start fresh onboarding:**
   - Navigate to `/onboarding`
   - Complete all 5 steps
   - Watch AI generation progress

3. **Verify personalization:**
   - Check dashboard for custom welcome message
   - View assessments for personalized sequence
   - Confirm skill areas match preferences

4. **Check persistence:**
   - Refresh page
   - Data should load from localStorage
   - Use "Refresh from DB" to sync

## üìù Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
OPENAI_PERSONALIZATION_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Personalization not showing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage has 'userPersonalization' key
3. Use "Refresh from DB" button
4. Check backend logs for generation errors

### 404 on /api/personalization/generate:
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check authentication token is present
- Confirm Clerk webhook is configured

### Empty assessments page:
- Complete onboarding first
- Check if personalization.assessmentPlan exists
- Verify assessmentSequence array is populated
