# CLAUDE.md - Corp1o1 Project Overview

## Project Description
**Corp1o1** is a revolutionary AI-powered skills assessment and learning platform that replaces traditional diploma-based evaluation with real competency analysis. The platform features blockchain-secured certificates, personalized learning paths, and advanced AI analytics for both individual learners and enterprise clients.

**Key Value Proposition**: "L'Ãˆre des CompÃ©tences" (The Skills Era) - Moving beyond outdated credentials to actual talent recognition through AI.

## Current Development Status
**Phase 1: COMPLETED** âœ… - Core User Data Integration & Profile Management
**Phase 2: IN PLANNING** ðŸ“‹ - Learning System Integration with detailed 166-task roadmap
**Backend Server**: Running on port 3001 with MongoDB integration
**Frontend**: Next.js 15 with Clerk authentication and real user data

## Recent changes (Aug 2025)
- Added assessments proxy routes with dev fallback (uses `x-dev-auth: true` if no Authorization):
  - `/app/api/assessments/generate-questions/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/assessments/evaluate/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/assessments/plan/route.ts`
- New wizard at `/assessments/new` to collect intake and create a 3-assessment plan (diagnostic, focused, stretch) via backend plan API.
- Auto-start planned assessments: `/assessments?planned=<json>` triggers Redux session start, question generation, and navigation into `/assessments/{generatedId}`.
- Improved Redux thunks to accept `token` and surface backend error messages.

## How to run
1. Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Set `.env.local` â†’ `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001`

## Quick test
- Create plan at `/assessments/new` â†’ click Start on a plan
- Questions are generated through the proxy and UI navigates into the assessment
- Essay answers are evaluated via proxy; difficulty terms are normalized backend-side
